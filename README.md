Car Purchase Amount Prediction
🔍 Problem Statement
Predict the car purchase amount a customer is likely to spend based on their personal and financial information.

🧠 Concept Used
Supervised Learning (Regression)

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Feature Scaling (MinMaxScaler)

Train-Test Split and Validation

💻 Technologies & Language
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

TensorFlow / Keras (for neural network modeling)

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing and splitting)

🛠 Problem Solved
Traditional pricing models fail to personalize car purchase predictions. This project builds a deep learning model that:

Understands nonlinear patterns in user data

Predicts purchase behavior accurately using key features like income, age, and debt

🌍 Real-Time Use Case
Used by automobile companies, financial services, or car loan providers to:

Estimate a customer’s purchase potential

Offer personalized financing plans

Improve targeted marketing and sales conversion

📁 Input Features
Gender

Age

Annual Salary

Credit Card Debt
